### Overview

PayMongo allows you to refund your customer's payments in full or partial amounts. A payment with a status of `paid` are the payments that can be refunded via the PayMongo dashboard or via our Public API. Kindly note that only **live transactions** can be refunded.

The refund will be deducted from your upcoming payout balance. The refund can't be canceled anymore when it's been requested and processed.

> Payout balance
> 
> If your upcoming payout balance is not enough to cover the refund, the request will not push through until there is a sufficient balance amount.

Refunds can only be made a certain time after the payment has been made:

| Transaction type                   | Timespan                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Debit and credit card transactions | Within 60 days from the date of payment  |
| GCash transactions                 | Within 180 days from the date of payment |
