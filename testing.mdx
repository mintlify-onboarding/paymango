## Cards

### Basic test card numbers

Use any of the following test card numbers with a valid expiration date in the future and any random CVC number to create a successful payment.

### 3D Secure Test Card Numbers

These are test credit card numbers for PaymentIntents API. Tokens API does not support 3DS authentication, therefore these cards will return an error if tokenized.

| Card Number      | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 4230000000000004 | 3DS authentication must be completed but will be declined with generic\_decline sub code before authentication. A payment with a failed status will still be created.           |
| 5234000000000106 | 3DS authentication must be completed but will be declined with generic\_decline sub code after successful authentication. A payment with a failed status will still be created. |
| 5123000000000001 | 3DS authentication is supported but not required. The payment will be marked as paid.                                                                                           |

### Test card numbers with specific scenarios

Test cards below can be used to create payments that return specific error responses. This is useful for testing different errors scenarios. Required length and format for CVC and future dates for expiration dates are required in order to proceed with testing.

## Other payment methods

Testing using other payment methods will return test checkout URLs. This is a checkout URL provided by PayMongo to simulate `successful` and `failed` checkout scenarios.

   
## Webhooks

To receive events when testing webhooks, you must first create one using your test mode API key. You will then receive data that are in test mode via your created webhook. When you are done with the integration, you must create another webhook, but this time using your live mode API key in order to receive live data. If you will retain the test webhook once you go live, you have to make sure that you are checking the data in the proper mode. Another suggestion is to disable the test webhook once you go live.
