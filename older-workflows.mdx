## Migrating from older workflows

If you are currently using the **Sources workflow** to integrate via our API and accept GCash and GrabPay payments, we highly recommend migrating to the [Payment Intents workflow](/docs/pipm-workflow) as soon as possible. Not only will it be easier in the future to just manage one payment workflow especially as we add more features, but managing webhooks is now an optional step. This makes the integration less complicated as it requires less steps.

### Comparing the workflows
