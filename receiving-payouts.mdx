By default, PayMongo generates your payouts every Tuesday and sends it to our banking partner for processing the following day. Our team automatically processes this so there's no need for requests from your end. Our default cut-off for payout clearing is every Tuesday. So if your payments were cleared by Tuesday, you'll receive them as part of the Wednesday payout. 

You will be able check your upcoming remittances, as well as your payout history in your Payouts Dashboard. Also, you can also generate payment reports for all your accounting needs.
