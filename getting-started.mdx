To get started, you will need to create an account on [our website](https://dashboard.paymongo.com/signup) by inputting your basic information such as your email, name, contact number, and password. After submitting, you will receive a verification email immediately.

Before you can proceed to your PayMongo dashboard, you have to verify the email first! This is to make sure that you have access to the email to receive KYC questions, early access emails, and a lot more.

The confirmation email should look something like this:

Clicking on the button will automatically verify your email address, no need to respond back to the confirmation email! 

Once activated, you will be redirected to the [activation page](https://dashboard.paymongo.com/activate) where you will submit your documents for activation. The process for activation usually takes up to 14 business days upon submission of all required documents.

<Note>Note that you cannot accept live payments yet if you are not yet activated. By default, your account will be placed in test mode. This means your business can't accept payments from customers yet.</Note>
