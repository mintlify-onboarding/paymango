**Account configuration is required before live transactions**

We need to configure your account before you can start accepting live payments. Kindly message **[\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#06757376766974724676677f6b696861692865696b)** to request for key configuration. Your account's eligibility will be reviewed before you can access this feature.
</Warning>

Card Installments is one of the most convenient ways to accept **0%-interest** credit card installment payments, without going through multiple negotiations.

The best thing about this is that you give your customers flexible payment options with 3/6/12 month installments while **you get paid in full** after the first payment.

The minimum transaction amount is set as 3,000 PHP across all banks. Any transactions less than 3,000 PHP can't be processed through Installments. We currently accept Asia United Bank (AUB), LandBank, and Security Bank cardholders but we are already working on accepting other banks.

This feature is available and live for websites using the PayMongo API, PayMongo Pages, PayMongo Links and the Shopify plugin.
