### Rate Limiting

A rate limit is the number of API calls an app or user can make within a time period. We hard enforce our rate limit as follows:

1. Users retrying a 401 error 10 times within 60 seconds will be blocked from the API for 30 days
2. Users can retry a 404 error up to 30 times per 60 seconds

Users who meet the conditions above will receive the error: `too_many_requests`. If this happens, kindly contact [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e2868794878e8d92879091a292839b8f8d8c858dcc818d8f).
