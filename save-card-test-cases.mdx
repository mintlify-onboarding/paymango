title: "Save Card Test Cases"
description: "If you find yourself needing to vault cards, you can also refer to the tests below. They mimic the same test cases as straight payments. The difference is that during card enrollment with failed scenarios, the card is not vaulted."

> These are the test cases when enrolling a card
> 
> Pre-requisites:
> 
> * Customer must be present under the organization so that card can be vaulted:  
>   * POST /customers/  
>   * Phone number and email must be unique for the customer during creation
> * Payment Intent should have the setup\_future\_usage section populated with the existing customer object owned by the organization
> * Successful payment must be done for payment method to be vaulted

Note:  
Below test cases can also be done via Manual Capture flow; expected results should also be the same as in the Manual Capture section, aside from the vaulting expected results.

### Reusing Vaulted Cards

For vaulted cards, here are the test cases when reusing a vaulted card. We will add test cases in the future where one can simulate an enrolled card that fails on reuse. 

> ### ðŸ“˜
> 
> Pre-requisites:
> 
> * A Card/Payment Method should already be vaulted  
>   * Customer Payment Method is present for the organization (see vaulting scenarios in the previous section)
> * In Payment Intent creation; do not make use of setup\_future\_usage with a different customer id as the customer used in the vaulting of the Payment Method (this will return an error if the vaulted card is attempted for vaulting to a different customer)
