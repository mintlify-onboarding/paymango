Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) is becoming more and more popular among e-commerce businesses in recent years. It is particularly helpful for high-ticket items like electronics, household appliances, and furniture. BNPL is also starting to become a widely accepted payment method in a lot of other industries, like fashion, beauty, and even education.

With PayMongo, you can now allow your customers to use flexible installment loans for their purchases via BNPL options such as Atome and BillEase.

Additionally, regardless of the plans your clients select, you will receive a full settlement upfront, allowing you to better plan your operational budget. You don't have to worry about chargeback threats because our BNPL partners will handle them for you!

  Here's how your customers can pay you through Atome or BillEase: 

### Atome (Currently Disabled)

<Warning>

**Atome is currently disabled**

We would just like to inform you that PayMongo will be temporarily disabling Atome as a payment option on the platform due to the ongoing technical issues with Atome's banking system.

Kindly note that during this time, the Atome payment option will be removed upon checkout and customers won't see this payment option for the time being. We recommend notifying your customers and colleagues to avoid any confusion.

Rest assured that we'll be sending out updates once Atome payments has been enabled again. 

Feel free to reach out to [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#daa9afaaaab5a8ae9aaabba3b7b5b4bdb5f4b9b5b7) should you have any questions regarding this.
</Warning>

Atome automatically splits your customer's bill into 3 equal payments (fixed) once they check out and click on Atome as their preferred payment method. They'll pay the first payment at the point of purchase. The next two payments will be spread 30 days apart!

1. After reviewing and confirming the payment breakdown, they can now click on "Pay using Atome" where they will be redirected to a different check-out page. From there, they just have to log in and input their OTPs.
2. Tick off the T&Cs to Atome's Loan Agreement and click "Confirm Payment"

That's it! After the first payment, you can head on over to your dashboard and it should already show up as completely paid.

### BillEase

BillEase helps your customers by extending a credit line that can be repaid through varying installment plans! BillEase users can repay their loans via e-wallets, online banking, and/or OTC. 

1. Customer selects BillEase as their payment method – Your customers can choose to pay via BillEase on your website.
