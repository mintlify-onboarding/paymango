PayMongo is currently partnered with **Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI)** and **UnionBank of the Philippines (UBP)** in accepting direct online banking payments.

You can conveniently take payments through direct online banking by:

* Safely connecting your customers' bank accounts and facilitate subsequent transactions
* drawing money right out of the bank account of your consumer and processing their payments through the same platform
* Instantaneous fund settlement provides better visibility and quick access to your money.

   
Here's how your customer's can pay you through Online Banking: 

1. Review and confirm the payment breakdown, then choose either BPI or UnionBank Online as your payment method.
