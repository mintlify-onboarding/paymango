## Our payment methods

Currently, we allow merchants to accept Visa/Mastercard debit and credit cards (straight/installment payments), BillEase (Buy Now, Pay Later) GCash, GrabPay, Maya, Coins.ph, Online banking via BPI/UBP, and over-the-counter payments (M Lhuillier, and Cebuana).

Once your account is activated, we will be processing your account and your business documents will be sent to our financial partners for onboarding.

### Payment method activation

Generally, all the payment methods should be added to your account after 5 business days, starting from when you got activated! 

If you are keen on trying it out and want to check what these transactions look like, you can already do test transactions through your dashboard under test mode.
