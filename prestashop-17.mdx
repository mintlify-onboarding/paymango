* For the Webhook URL - add _/module/paymongo/webhooks_ to your PrestaShop store URL. For example, if your PrestaShop store URL is [https://paymongo.com](https://paymongo.com), the URL to be inputted will be [https://paymongo.com/module/paymongo/webhooks](https://paymongo.com/module/paymongo/webhooks). **Take note whether your site starts with _http_ or _https_ and input it accordingly**
* Click the "Generate Webhook" button and you'll receive the following response. Take note of your webhook's secret key (highlighted in red in the sample image below).
