### Hold then Capture on Shopify

Our Hold then Capture card feature is now available on Shopify! This allows you to place a hold on a card payment and then capture or charge it at a later time. 

Most businesses that use this feature are food, retail, and delivery merchants that hold the customer's payment upon ordering but capture the funds upon stock verification or order pick-up. Service providers also use this feature to hold funds when a customer books or schedules an appointment. They are then able to charge at a later time once the schedule is confirmed or the service is fulfilled. **The great thing about this feature is that you can adapt it to fit your operational processes and business needs.**

You can learn more about the Hold then Capture feature by checking out our [quick guide](/docs/hold-then-capture).

### Installing Hold then Capture on Shopify

This process should take less than 5 minutes and can be done even without any developer experience.

> ### ❗️
> 
> Using both PayMongo Shopify plugins
> 
> At the moment, PayMongo supports 2 Shopify plugins namely "Credit/Debit Card via PayMongo" and "Secure Payments via PayMongo".
> 
> "Credit/Debit Card via PayMongo" only supports card payments and the Hold then Capture card feature.  
> "Secure Payments via PayMongo" supports card, e-wallet, buy now pay later, and our online banking payment options.
> 
> If you will be using both plugins and you want to use the Hold then Capture card feature, make sure to disable the card payment option on the "Secure Payments via PayMongo" plugin to avoid confusion with your customers. Kindly refer to our page on editing payment methods on Shopify.

Both PayMongo Shopify plugins on the Shopify checkout page.

  
#### Switch to Manual Capture in your Shopify settings

Once you have installed the plugin and your PayMongo account is activated for the Hold then Capture card feature, you can now proceed to switch to Manual Capture in your Shopify settings. 

> ### 🚧
> 
> Kindly note: Setting the payment capture to manual will affect all your payment plugins that support manual capture. In PayMongo's case, manual capture (or Hold then Capture) is only available on the "Credit/Debit Card via PayMongo" plugin. 
> 
> Shopify's guide on this can be found [here](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/payments/payment-authorization).

Steps:

1. On your Shopify Settings page, go to Payments and click "Manage" under Payment capture. By default, it is set to "Automatic".

Payments page in the Shopify settings

   1. "Automatically when order is fulfilled"  
   2. "Manually capture payment for orders"  
   Once you have chosen an option for the payment capture method, click "Save".
