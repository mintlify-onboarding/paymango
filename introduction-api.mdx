---

We built the PayMongo API for those who want to directly integrate PayMongo on their site or app. Using the API allows you to take full control of the user's experience and integrate the payment workflow directly with your systems and databases. The PayMongo API is [RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational%5FState%5FTransfer) and follows the [JSON:API specifications](https://jsonapi.org/) for request bodies and responses. All response codes, authentication and verbs use standard HTTP. Our API is always available at [https://api.paymongo.com](https://api.paymongo.com). 

### Building a custom payment experience

Through the PayMongo API, you can fully customize your customers' checkout experience. This is done by implementing the [Payment Intent Workflow](/docs/pipm-workflow) (cards, card installments, GCash, GrabPay, Maya, BillEase and direct online banking payments). We highly recommend this to our enterprise merchants or to those who want full control over the customer's payment flow.

### Checkout API

[PayMongo's Checkout API](/docs/checkout-api) allows you to create a powerful checkout experience without having to build your own. You can now streamline your payments integration using our pre-built user-friendly hosted checkout page. We have simplified the checkout process for customers while ensuring a secure digital payment experience. 

### Links API

You could use our Links API to generate [PayMongo Links ](/docs/links). For this case, our merchants usually use the Links API for bulk sending, chatbots, and automated emails.
