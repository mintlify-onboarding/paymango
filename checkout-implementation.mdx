description: "How do I implement the Checkout API?"
---

**The Checkout API is used to accept these payment methods:**

| Category                     | Payment Method                          |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Credit & Debit Card payments | Straight card paymentsCard installments |
| E-Wallets                    | MayaGCashGrabPay                        |
| Buy Now, Pay Later           | BillEase                                |
| Direct Online Banking        | BPI OnlineUnionBank Online              |

  The Checkout API is the easiest way to integrate PayMongo into your custom made website or app. Building an integration with the Checkout API involves two actions: creating a Checkout Session and redirecting the customer to the Checkout Session. To fully automate your payment journey, we recommend the use of [webhooks](/docs/webhooks) to listen each time a payment has been made. 

## Implementation

> ### 📘
> 
> In navigating this guide, you will encounter API References. **API References** are pages where you can test out and view the fields for each API call. These pages also contains a description on the available fields.

### 1\. Checking allowed payment methods

[API Reference](https://developers.paymongo.com/reference/retrieve-list-of-possible-merchant-payment-methods) 

The allowed payment methods might be different for each account. You can call the [Retrieve list of possible merchant payment methods](/reference/retrieve-list-of-possible-merchant-payment-methods) endpoint to view which payment methods are eligible for your account.

 ### 2\. Creating a Checkout Session from the server-side

[API Reference](https://developers.paymongo.com/reference/create-a-checkout) 

To start receiving payments with the Checkout API, you must create a Checkout Session object. You must create your Checkout Session from your backend using your [secret API key](/docs/authentication#section-public-and-secret-keys). One order or transaction should have a unique Checkout Session object. When filling up the `payment_method_types` field, kindly make sure that this matches with your allowed payment methods. You could opt to filter out the payment method type. Send the response to the client-side. The `checkout_url` will be used to redirect the customer to a PayMongo checkout page. 

**Optional:** We recommend you to store the Checkout Session object's ID (example: `cs_zmkoMv8GQBSdaPZfJrmFnifG`) in your database. This would allow you to retrieve the Checkout Session object using your Secret key.

 ### 3\. Redirecting the customer for payment

Using the `checkout_url` response from the first step, redirect the customer to the PayMongo checkout page. 

**Note:** Using iframes might lead to inconsistent behavior; this is due to our payment providers setting their own CORS policies. 

JavaScript

`// The example is using axios as the REST client on the client-side.

//  This is the call to your server side when creating a Checkout Session
//  Note that this is entirely up to your implementation
axios.post(
  'https://yourserver.com/create-a-checkout',
  {
    data: {
      your_custom_order_parameters: {
        items: [{
          item: "Bag",
          quantity: 2,
          amount: 30000
				}],
      }
    }
  },
).then(function(response) {
  
  // Parsing the response and redirecting the customer for authentication
  const checkout_url = response.data.attributes.checkout_url

	// Option 1: similar behavior as an HTTP redirect
	window.location.replace(checkout_url);

	// Option 2: similar behavior as clicking on a link
	window.location.href = checkout_url;
})
`

After redirecting the customer to the PayMongo Checkout, the customer would be able to pay with the payment method of their choice. 

If the payment is successful, the customer would be redirected to the nominated `success_url` or a generic payment success screen. 

If the payment failed, the customer would be redirected to back to the payment method selection page.

 ### 3\. Finish

The payment should reflect on your PayMongo dashboard. 

If you've enabled the `send_email_receipt` field, your customer would receive an email receipt after a successful transaction.

You could use [Webhooks](/docs/webhooks) to listen to the status of the payment in your backend. With webhooks, we'll be sending your servers a POST message for your nominated events. Relevant webhook events are `payment.paid`, `payment.failed`, `checkout_session.payment.paid`. 

> ### 🚧
> 
> Webhooks
> 
> You should not create a webhook in your code. You can try using API tools such as Postman or curl to create your webhook once. Please take note that you should not create multiple webhooks for every source that will be created. One webhook with events `payment.paid` and `payment.failed` or one webhook with the `checkout_session.payment.paid` event is enough to receive the payment information.

Event notifications will be sent to your registered webhook endpoint containing relevant payment information as shown below:

checkout\_session.payment.paid Event for a successful Checkout Session payment
