### Editing Payment Methods on your checkout page

If you have multiple PayMongo accounts or you want to opt-in/out of certain payment methods, you can configure your checkout page anytime by clicking the **Manage** button on "Secure Payments via PayMongo" plugin settings.

After clicking on Manage, you will be redirected to this screen wherein you can select which payment methods you want to accept in your Shopify checkout or change the PayMongo account associated with your store.

You can then click on the "Save payment method" button to finalize your checkout.

In the example above, this is what the customer will see on the checkout page after saving the updates.

This is a different checklist which only impacts which payment method icons appear when a customer is selecting payment methods on the Shopify checkout page (image on the right).
