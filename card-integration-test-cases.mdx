These detailed test cases can be used to check your card integration with PayMongo. This step is optional but we **highly recommend** running these cases. These test cases were developed along with our internal QA team to account for every possible flow through the system.

## Recommended Test Cases

This shows the test cases for all scenarios regardless if you integrate straight card payments, save card, or the hold then capture integration.
